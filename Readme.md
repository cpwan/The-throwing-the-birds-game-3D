This is a project i did in the *Physically-based Simulation in Computer Graphics* course when i went on exchange at ETH Zurich in 2018 Fall. In the project, my teammate Felix Hasler, and i built the well known Angry Bird game in 3D. We won the 4th place in class. See our names in the hall of fame [here](https://cgl.ethz.ch/teaching/simulation18/fame.php)!
